# CodingBat_Python
These are my answers to the Python problems at Nick Parlante's CodingBat.com. 

I did not include my answers to the warmups, as Nick already included solutions for those problems on his site.

I'm a novice programmer and used Python 2.7. 

Please feel free to suggest ways that I can make my code more efficient!
